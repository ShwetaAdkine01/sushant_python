"""
In python, left hand value(x) % right hand value(y), if x<y then rem is x 
'/' division gives answer in float and '//' floor division gives answer in int or rounded down to lowest integer 
and in negative higher is less. For example, -2.5 is rounded down to its lowest integer i.e. -3
x+=3 is x=x+3, x**=2 mean x = x**2
